    <h1><u>A one sided story</u></h1>
<ul>
    <li><p>The day I met her</p>
    <p>I was just too young to know what she was</p>
<p>She was just a friend to me</p>
<p>But,I was a competitor to her</p>
<p>I was too innocent to know myself</p>
</li>
<li><p>During the pandemic,I was lost</p>
<p>So lost,that I still couldn't find what I am</p>
<p>She knew herself,kept getting better</p>
</li>
<li><p>Me in my downfall,No one at my back</p>
<p>Somehow managed to get out of it</p>
<p>Life was peace until I met her again</p>
<p>Lonely me,got attached to her</p></li>
<li><p>She was with someone</p>
<p>It broke my heart into million pieces</p>
<p>I maintained distance,I was happy</p>
<p>Life became peace as before</p></li>
<li><p>Met her again in 10th</p>
<p>She broke up with his ex</p>
<p>Made me her so called "Male Best Friend"</p>
<p>I was happy, cuz I had a role in other's life for the first time</p></li>
<li><p>Was completely unknown of how disturbing, it could be</p>
<p>Got attached to her again,became happy</p>
<p>I had a crush on her,I expressed it,Got friend-zoned</p>
<p>I moved on,but still had some feelings for her</p></li>
<li><p>She sent me pics with her ex</p>
<p>She sent me screenshots of chats with her new best freind</p>
<p>I was okay with it,But after a day,she said she doesn't want to talk to me</p>
<p>My mind went numb for a moment,I thought that this is it(END) </p></li>
<li><p>I stopped texting her</p>
<p>2 days later,She texted me(about studies) </p>
<p>Now,This is the only thing we talk about</p>
<p>I believe this friendship will last only till 10th</p>
<p>Thus,I don't want me to ruin my potential for her</p></li>
<li>The only quote I believe in now is -<h1>"REGRET is the best REVENGE"</h1></li>
</ul>
